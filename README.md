# Google-homepage
an Odin project assignment on the basics of HTML and css

Intro
This is a project to test my understanding of the basics of HTML 
and css that i have learnt so far. I will be copying the Google
homepage, the aim being to see if i can replicate the elements 
used as well as the positioning and styling applied. The form will
not be fully functional just have the look and feel of the original.
